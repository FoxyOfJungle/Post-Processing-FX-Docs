## Introduction

Post-processing is a generic term for a full-screen image processing effect that occurs after the overall rendering of the game. Post-processing can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time.

You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties.

For information about requirements and compatibility, see section [Requirements](./pages/requirements.md).
